Our [FAQ][faq] covers many common questions; check that first. Also try searching old posts, either [via google][google] or via reddit's search.\n3. Your question isn't answered in the FAQ? Please read the following:\n\n## Getting debugging help\n\nIf your question is about code, make sure it's **specific** and **provides all information up-front**. Here's a checklist of what to include:\n\n1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].\n2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.\n4.  A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that demonstrates your problem.\n5. The output you expected and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.\n\nDo your best to solve your problem before posting. The quality of the answers will be proportional to the amount of effort you put into your post. Note that title-only posts are automatically removed.\n\nAlso see [our full posting guidelines][debugging] and the [subreddit rules][rules]. After you post a question, **DO NOT** delete it!\n\n## Asking conceptual questions\n\nAsking conceptual questions is ok, but please check [our FAQ][faq] and search older posts first.\n\nIf you plan on asking a question similar to one in the FAQ, explain what exactly the FAQ didn't address and clarify what you're looking for instead. See our full guidelines on [asking conceptual questions][conceptual] for more details.\n\n## Subreddit rules\n\nPlease read [our rules][rules] and [other policies][policies] before posting.

I wanna find some resources like that for all the common stuff in web apps.  But I've only found a few. \n\n\nI'm looking for like some high level resources in regards to web apps that highlight common structures, patterns, and pieces that go into web apps in general, and then maybe they drill down into the details.  I often see tutorials based on a specific language or some piece of functionality but I feel like it's been harder to find resources that step back and talk about all the common pieces of web apps as a whole and how they are supposed to fit together.  I also feel like it would be better maybe to practice building the different pieces for a while and getting a handle on them before tackling an entire monster app.    \n\n\nI dunno, for example  login systems, security, sessions, cookies, setting up auto emails, charging credit cards, doing stuff with databases  etc.   ",

        '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  I tend to like to learn things top down. Get a high level overview of what&amp;#39;s involved then drill down.  Kinda like a table of contents.  I wanna find some resources like that for all the common stuff in web apps.  But I&amp;#39;ve only found a few. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for like some high level resources in regards to web apps that highlight common structures, patterns, and pieces that go into web apps in general, and then maybe they drill down into the details.  I often see tutorials based on a specific language or some piece of functionality but I feel like it&amp;#39;s been harder to find resources that step back and talk about all the common pieces of web apps as a whole and how they are supposed to fit together.  I also feel like it would be better maybe to practice building the different pieces for a while and getting a handle on them before tackling an entire monster app.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dunno, for example  login systems, security, sessions, cookies, setting up auto emails, charging credit cards, doing stuff with databases  etc.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

And then this is where everything goes pear-shaped. The problem is I have so many different problems each time I try to do this (which so far has been 10-15 attempts) that I'm just absolutely lost. I have no idea what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most recent error I've been getting is that when I make changes, stage, and commit/push them, it basically says it can't connect to the repo or that the repo doesn't exist. I uninstalled Eclipse and reinstalled it, and did the same with my JDK, deleting all the old, unused ones in the process to reduce the clutter.  \n\n\nFurthermore, I'm also trying to use JavaFX for the project. It works fine, except that any time I want to look at the background code of an object or method or something by hitting F3, I get taken to the appropriate class file (e.g. Scene.class), but it says \"Source Not Found.\" How can this be, since I'm using the freshly-installed JDK 11?!  \n\n\nThis project is due in two days and I have nothing to show for it because of all this baloney.

        'Hey guys! Computer science undergrad here, I\'ve just started my advanced programming concepts unit on my course and had a reflective question that I just wanted to make sure I had the right approach for. I\'m currently investigating race conditions in Java, primarily this code in question:\n\n    public class Race {\n    \n        public static void main(String args []) throws Exception {\n    \n            MyThread.count = 0 ;\n    \n            MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();\n            MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();\n    \n            thread1.start() ;\n            thread2.start() ;\n    \n            thread2.join() ;\n            thread1.join() ;\n    \n            System.out.println("MyThread.count = " + MyThread.count) ;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    class MyThread extends Thread {\n    \n        volatile static int count ;\n    \n        public void run() {\n    \n            for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; 1000000000 ; i++) {\n                int x = count ;\n                count = x + 1 ;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nI experimented with changing the method of incrementing the count variable by using a couple of other options, those being:\n\n    public void run() {\n    \n            for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; 1000000000 ; i++) {\n                count = count + 1;\n            }\n        }\n    \n    public void run() {\n    \n            for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; 1000000000 ; i++) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n\nThe question I have is - **What do the results tell you about atomicity of various Java statements?**\n\nI found that using count++ and count = count + 1 produces results that were far more affected by the race condition than the original method was. The result was about 100,000,000 less than it was with the original increment method. Am I right in thinking that this means these two functions actually have more atomicity than the first function, because they isolate and "reserve" the count variable better than the first one did?\n\nHope my question makes sense! Many thanks.\n\nEdit: Having said all that, maybe a higher result would mean better atomicity because the variable was better isolated by each thread so they could both add more to the count variable without being interrupted by the opposite thread?',

        "I'm currently enrolled in an OS class, and this assignment has to deal with system calls. For the most part, I have the assignment figured out but there's one area that I'm stuck on. \n\nOur first two system calls that we have to implement involve adding a variable to the 'cpu' struct and manipulating that variable, which I have accomplished. We also have to write a call that will print out the name of the currently running process, and write a call that will change the name of the currently running process. Here are some of my code snippets, which are in my sysproc.c file:\n\n    struct cpu myCpu; (I declared an extern cpu named myCpu in the proc.h file, so this is linked to that)\n    void\n    sys_getcurrentProcessName(void)\n    {\n        cprintf(myCpu.proc-&gt;name);\n    }\n\nand\n\n    void\n    sys_modifycurrentProcessName(char* newName)\n    {\n        argstr(0, &amp;newName);\n        \n        strncpy(myCpu.proc-&gt;name, newName, 8);\n    }\n\nMy call to change the name works great, but my call to print out the name of the currently running process doesn't print anything out the first time it is run (after the name is changed, it will print out the new name that I changed it to). Is this expected behavior? I would expect that the currently running process would have a starting name before I change it. Any help would be most appreciated!",

        '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently enrolled in an OS class, and this assignment has to deal with system calls. For the most part, I have the assignment figured out but there&amp;#39;s one area that I&amp;#39;m stuck on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our first two system calls that we have to implement involve adding a variable to the &amp;#39;cpu&amp;#39; struct and manipulating that variable, which I have accomplished. We also have to write a call that will print out the name of the currently running process, and write a call that will change the name of the currently running process. Here are some of my code snippets, which are in my sysproc.c file:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct cpu myCpu; (I declared an extern cpu named myCpu in the proc.h file, so this is linked to that)\nvoid\nsys_getcurrentProcessName(void)\n{\n    cprintf(myCpu.proc-&amp;gt;name);\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void\nsys_modifycurrentProcessName(char* newName)\n{\n    argstr(0, &amp;amp;newName);\n\n    strncpy(myCpu.proc-&amp;gt;name, newName, 8);\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My call to change the name works great, but my call to print out the name of the currently running process doesn&amp;#39;t print anything out the first time it is run (after the name is changed, it will print out the new name that I changed it to). Is this expected behavior? I would expect that the currently running process would have a starting name before I change it. Any help would be most appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

        '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So currently I am very confident with C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little bit of C++. I would like to start working on a project which is a game that is basically a 2D platformer with the potential for real time live multiple options. As far as I can understand this would be achievable with c++. However I would like to know if perhaps putting in the time to learn another language such as python or something would be better suited to create such a project?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankyou for your time!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

From what I've seen online it looks like most of these developers configure the CRM and don't actually write a lot of code (this is not a bash, just my assumption of how the software is meant to be developed on).  I guess my current association is that it's \"WordPress\"y.\n\nAre there any questions that I can use to evaluate on these developer candidates?  I have over a decade of application development experience in several languages, but most of my work recently is with web and mobile apps.\n\nThank you!",

From what I&amp;#39;ve seen online it looks like most of these developers configure the CRM and don&amp;#39;t actually write a lot of code (this is not a bash, just my assumption of how the software is meant to be developed on).  I guess my current association is that it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;WordPress&amp;quot;y.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any questions that I can use to evaluate on these developer candidates?  I have over a decade of application development experience in several languages, but most of my work recently is with web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',
